While covering the&#xA0; <a href=\"http://nyulocal.com/city/2012/12/04/cooper-union-students-stage-lock-in-to-protest-a-tuition-increase/\">Cooper Union student protests</a>, Hayes included video footage of the quirkiest aspect of the demonstration thus far in a segment called &#x201C;Moment of Geek.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Since Monday, a group of students have organized a sit-in on the 8th floor of the Foundation Building as a means to oppose the potential tuition change at the school. In the clip, starting at the 3:17 mark, we see the students inventing a pulley-like contraption to deliver pizza to the hungry protesters.</p>\n<p>Using balloons, string, and a counter-weight, the students created a system to deliver Two Boots pizza to the 8th floor window, managing to keep the box flat and the pie intact. As Hayes aptly noted, &#x201C;These are quality engineers and future engineers we&#x2019;re talking about&#x201D; and this machine is &#x201C;ingenius.&#x201D; We couldn&#x2019;t have said it better ourselves.</p>\n<p>Hayes finished the segment by saying &#x201C;this [pizza-pulley] not only keeps their bellies well fed, but also it keeps their dreams of trying to protect a free college education alive for another day.&#x201D; If only there was a pizza-pulley machine installed in Bobst.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>",
