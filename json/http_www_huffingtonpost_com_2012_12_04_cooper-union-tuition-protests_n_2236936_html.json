Shortly after becoming the school's president in 2011, Bharucha said Cooper Union would <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/education/cooper-union-may-charge-tuition-to-undergraduates.html?_r=0\" target=\"_hplink\">likely have to start making students pay to attend</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On Monday, student activists released a <a href=\"http://www.pdf-archive.com/2012/12/04/summary/\" target=\"_hplink\">memo they say was drafted by Nerken Acting Dean Alan N. Wolf</a> that proposes <a href=\"http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2012/12/03/live-cooper-union-day-of-action/\" target=\"_hplink\">reducing scholarships for the engineering school's tuition</a> in order to reach revenue targets, the Free Press reports.</p>\n\n<p>Students earlier held <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-04-26/news/31400935_1_tuition-protest-free-tuition-charge-tuition\" target=\"_hplink\">demonstrations in April over the decision to charge tuition</a>, and at least two protesters were arrested at the time. No arrests related to Monday's protest were reported. </p>\n\n\t<p>During the demonstration, the activists held <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/students-seize-cooper-union-room-to-protest-possible-tuition/\" target=\"_hplink\">Occupy Wall Street-style workshops and teach-ins</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylerkingkade/status/275720219283046404/photo/1/large\" target=\"_hplink\">staged a mock \"funeral\" for the \"death of education.\"</a> The bottom floor of the Foundation Building remained open, where several students could be seen studying.</p>\n\n<p>Victoria Sobel, one of the Cooper Union occupiers, told The New York Times <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/students-seize-cooper-union-room-to-protest-possible-tuition/\" target=\"_hplink\">students had brought sleeping bags, blankets and ramen noodles</a> and would stay \"as long as necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"View Communique [Administration] on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/115358350\">Communique [Administration]</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p class=\"video_box_title\">Also on HuffPost:</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
