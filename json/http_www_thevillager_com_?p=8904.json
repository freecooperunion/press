Photo by&#xA0;Sam&#xA0;Spokony</p></div>\n<p><strong>BY SAM SPOKONY &#xA0;</strong>| &#xA0;Cooper Union students, with the support of more than 50 professors, are continuing vehement protests against the school administration&#x2019;s April announcement that it will begin charging tuition for graduate students next year, along with considering tuition charges for some undergraduates.</p>\n<p>Monday afternoon, 11 student protesters barricaded themselves in the historic clock tower on the eighth floor of the college&#x2019;s Foundation Building. After attempts by maintenance workers to remove them failed, the occupying students draped a large banner reading, &#x201C;Free Education To All,&#x201D; over the building&#x2019;s side.</p>\n<p>The students remained in the clock tower at press time.</p>\n<p>Cooper Union, which serves about 1,000 students, with schools in art, architecture and engineering, was founded in 1859 and has offered full-tuition scholarships to all its students since 1902. With buildings on Cooper Square and Astor Place, the college is one of a handful in the nation to offer a free education.</p>\n<p>Its full-tuition scholarships are currently valued at $38,550 per year, according to the college.</p>\n<p>The college was founded by inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper, whose son-in-law &#x2014; a major figure in the college&#x2019;s development around the turn of the 20th&#xA0;century &#x2014; advocated for starting the scholarships because, as he once said, education should be &#x201C;free as air and water.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But Cooper Union&#x2019;s current administration and president, Dr. Jamshed Bharucha, have argued that drastic measures are needed to keep the college from financial ruin.</p>\n<p>The school faced a 28 percent, or roughly $17 million, operating deficit for the 2011 fiscal year, while falling $53 million short of its goals for donations and overall endowment revenue, according to an October report by the college&#x2019;s Revenue Task Force.</p>\n<p>The task force aims to create $12 million in new revenue streams by fiscal year 2018. The report&#x2019;s creators estimated that a series of new, tuition-based, cross-disciplinary graduate programs at Cooper Union would bring in about $6.5 million by that time.</p>\n<p>To close the revenue gap, the task force raised the possibility of cutting undergraduate scholarships by 25 percent. According to the report, this would bring in about $6 million more in new revenue by fiscal year 2018.</p>\n<p>Anticipating outcry over that idea, the report&#x2019;s writers noted, &#x201C;Such a change should be implemented only when all other measures fall short of ensuring the survival of the school.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But many students and professors believe that an end to full tuition scholarships would permanently damage the overall character of Cooper Union.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;[By opting] for an expansionist, tuition-based model, President Bharucha has demonstrated that he is incapable of defending Cooper Union&#x2019;s mission and history of providing free education for all,&#x201D; said Rachel Appel, a senior in the college&#x2019;s School of Art, reading a statement prepared by the 11 occupying students, at a press conference outside the Foundation Building on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Also on Tuesday, Day Gleeson, an associate professor at the college, announced the writing of a letter, with more than 50 faculty signatures, in support of continued full scholarships for all enrolled students.</p>\n<p>Jolene Travis, a Cooper Union spokesperson, said in a statement that the 11 protesters occupying the clock tower &#x201C;do not reflect the views of a student population of&#xA0;approximately 1,000 architects, artists and engineers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But there were hundreds of students cheering when the occupiers waved from an eighth-floor window Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some of us are more outspoken than others,&#x201D; said student Chris Bennett, as he sat outside the Foundation Building smoking a cigarette that day, &#x201C;but everyone here supports them.&#x201D;</p>\n<div class=\"simplesocial-box\"><p class=\"simplesocial-title\">The Villager encourages readers to share articles:</p><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;t=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Email a Friend\" href=\"http://www.freetellafriend.com/tell/?heading=Share+This+Article&amp;bg=1&amp;option=email&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Blogger\" href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blog_this.pyra?t&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;n=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower&amp;pli=1\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Delicious\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;title=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;title=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Google\" href=\"http://www.google.com/bookmarks/mark?op=add&amp;bkmk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;title=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Myspace\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/Modules/PostTo/Pages/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;t=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower&amp;c=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;title=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Yahoo\" href=\"http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzz?targetUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;headline=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904&amp;title=Occupy+free+tuition%21+Cooper+students+take+historic+tower\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"Share on Technorati\" href=\"http://technorati.com/faves?sub=favthis&amp;add=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevillager.com%2F%3Fp%3D8904\"></a><a class=\"simplesocial\" title=\"RSS Feed\" href=\"http://www.thevillager.com/?feed=rss2\"></a></div><p class=\"small_text\">Shortlink: </p><div id=\"text-5\" class=\"widget widget_text\">\t\t\t<p class=\"textwidget\">We appreciate your comments and ask that you keep to the subject at hand, refrain from use of profanity and maintain a respectful tone to both the subject at hand and other readers who also post here.
