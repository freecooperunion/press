The protest comes after a vastly unpopular decision by their board of trustees, lead by school president&#xA0;Bharucha, <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/04/29/the-tragedy-of-cooper-union/\" target=\"_blank\">to end their more than 100 year tradition of a tuition-free school</a>. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">They are fighting</a> against an accelerating trend of&#xA0;introducing&#xA0;financial&#xA0;barriers to education around the world. And they&#x2019;re keeping it clean.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve <a href=\"http://discardstudies.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/tactics-of-waste-dirt-and-discard-in-the-occupy-movement-a-photo-essay/\" target=\"_blank\">written elsewhere</a> about how power struggles are often waged via dirt and discard. The Cooper Union protest is no different. Yesterday, Cooper Union higher-ups cut off access to water and bathrooms, removing the ability to keep and stay clean:</p>\n<blockquote><p>TC Westcott, Cooper Union&#x2019;s vice president of finance, arrived at 5 p.m. to tell students that they had an hour to leave, or face the school&#x2019;s judiciary process. Security guards cut off use of the 6th and 7th floor stairwells, and students found that their bathroom doors had been&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/332609536433221632\" target=\"_blank\">bolted shut</a>, along with a wooden board tamped over the water fountain.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If this protest follows an age-old script, at some point someone in power will declare that the sit in is threatening health and safety via poor&#xA0;sanitation, and that eviction is&#xA0;necessary&#xA0;for clean up. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s not political, it&#x2019;s just household chores.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in&#xA0;anticipation&#xA0;of this, but much more likely as a material and symbolic action that shows they care for their school, the sit-in students have posted countless animated gifs and images of them cleaning up the president&#x2019;s office.</p>\n<p>This short video was posted about ten minutes ago:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vine.co/v/b07pWL9rtDZ\">Cleaning the President&#x2019;s Office</a></p>\n<p>Last night, as the police came on campus, they were&#xA0;vacuuming, and <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/b2LtZrAg2ru\" target=\"_blank\">posted the process</a> on their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\" target=\"_blank\">twitter feed.&#xA0;</a></p>\n<p>A photo of the blackboard in the office shows the student&#x2019;s activist plans, and cleaning is mentioned more than once:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://discardstudies.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/coop_4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3075\" alt=\"Cooper Union Student Occupation\" src=\"http://discardstudies.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/coop_4.jpg?w=635\"></a></p>\n<p>Dirt and cleanliness are about dividing the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviours, about us and them, and about safe and unsafe. By making housekeeping such a visible part of their protest, whether&#xA0;conscious&#xA0;or not, Cooper students are making larger statements about their role in their institution, about inclusiveness, and about care, caretaking, and citizenship at Cooper Union.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://discardstudies.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/b2eec51ab83211e293e422000aaa088d_7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3076\" alt=\"b2eec51ab83211e293e422000aaa088d_7\" src=\"http://discardstudies.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/b2eec51ab83211e293e422000aaa088d_7.jpg?w=635\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Max Liboiron is a postdoctoral researcher with the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing and the Superstorm Research Lab.</em></p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-10243283-3074-53f96c72e63f9\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Like this:</h3><p class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></p><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<p id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</p></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div> \n</div>",
