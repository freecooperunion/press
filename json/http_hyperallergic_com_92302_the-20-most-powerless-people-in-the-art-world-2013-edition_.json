Not a single entry on the Power 100, while print media keeps firing their full-time art critics. It&#x2019;s so bad, some critics don&#x2019;t even bother putting their names on scathing takedowns of multi-million-dollar shows since it really doesn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p><p>2 &#x2014;&#xA0;<strong>Artists making &#x201C;self-portraits&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;selfies,&#x201D;&#xA0;</strong>Nothing says antiquated artisan more than a skilled self-portrait. Try an unskilled selfie that reflects on the democratization of the image in the contemporary era by empowering the masses to portray themselves &#x2026; oh, wait, then why do we even need artists? Never mind.</p><p><span>3 &#x2014;&#xA0;</span><strong>Identity-Politics Curators,&#xA0;</strong><span>Between </span><a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2013/10/25/piper-pulls-out-of-black-performance-art-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Adrian Piper</a><span> pulling out of the show </span><em>Radical Presence: Black Performance</em><span> in Contemporary Art and the artists of Jewish descent who declined to participate in the </span><em>Jew York</em><span> exhibition at Zach Feuer and Untitled galleries, it looks like curators who want to group or explore artists based on identity have hit hard times.</span></p><p>4 &#x2014;<strong>&#xA0;&#x201D;Same-ish&#x201D; Art and &#x201C;Modest Abstraction&#x201D; Painters,&#xA0;</strong>Art is about being different, right? Well, you probably don&#x2019;t think so if you <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/84620/is-all-the-stuff-at-art-fairs-the-same-ish/\" target=\"_blank\">visited the art fairs</a> &#x2014; &#x201C;Oh, look, it&#x2019;s another neon work saying something witty!&#x201D; Whether you&#x2019;re making &#x201C;crapstraction,&#x201D; &#x201C;found stuff on tables&#x201D; art, or something else that fits neatly into the &#xA0;white box, our advice: try harder because you seem powerless and unable to break free of the straightjacket of the commercial desires of the art market.</p><p>5 &#x2014;&#xA0;<strong>Detroit Institute of Arts, </strong>The DIA&#x2019;s director, president, and CEO&#xA0;Graham W.J. Beal and his board, not to mention DIA staff, members, and lovers, really must be feeling&#xA0;powerless&#xA0;as their fate seems dependent on the financial games of others. This is an institution that seems to have done a pretty good job&#xA0;at ensuring that the museum, in the midst of a city facing huge economic challenges, continues to make their world-class art collection available and accessible to the public. They even <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/55403/voters-rescue-detroit-institute-of-arts/\" target=\"_blank\">challenged the old axiom that Americans hate taxes</a> and got the surrounding counties to pony up to help them survive. Well, now, in the midst of a city-wide bankruptcy, the DIA is probably looking up at the vultures circling overhead, ready to swoop down on them at the first sign of weakness.</p><p>6 &#x2014;&#xA0;<strong>Non-Celebrity Artists,&#xA0;</strong>Marina Abramovi&#x107;! Jay Z, James Franco, Lady Gaga, need we say more?

When are they going to go post-space and just start accepting brands&#x2122;?</p><p>8 &#x2014;&#xA0;<strong>OWS, </strong>For the second year in a row, Occupy Wall Street makes the Powerless list, though they&#x2019;ve moved down one spot.&#xA0;The non-party is over as surviving working groups ponder whether or not to keep the OWS tag in their names. Once a powerful symbol of unity against income inequality, it&#x2019;s now a zombie tag. This breaks our hearts!

Rich people love some vaguely political work on the walls to suggest they can still feel &#x2026; something. And lest we forget&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.charlottestreet.org/2013/10/well-make-out-better-than-okay/\">art shows like this</a>, which scream powerlessness at its most extreme.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/58034/painted-pigeons-political-commentary-or-pop-street-art/\">Ahem</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/84106/a-political-edge-for-sf-asian-contemporary-art-week/\">SOMEBODY</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/60382/political-art-galloping-out-of-the-past/\">at</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/47689/maximo-gonzalez/\">Hyperallegic</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/75039/its-the-political-economy-stupid-the-global-financial-crisis-in-art-and-theory/\">didn&#x2019;t</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/32608/the-art-of-political-memes/\">get</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/70488/remembering-arts-role-in-social-change/\">the</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/87532/a-giant-ear-for-politicians/\">memo</a>, but we don&#x2019;t worry about crushing our contributors&#x2019; feelings!

We used to want real non-PR reviews of shows. Now those are just seen as &#x201C;mean.&#x201D; And it appears that this isn&#x2019;t only a problem in the field of contemporary art, since the new book <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/11/buzzfeed-decides-criticizing-awful-books-too-mean/71366/\" target=\"_blank\">editor of Buzzfeed</a> says they won&#x2019;t be publishing negative reviews of books.

People are starting to wonder if this might be the beginning of a scary trend. With&#xA0;530 million photographs being uploaded to the internet every day, you can see how photojournalists might feel powerless when there&#x2019;s always someone there before you ready to snap and share a pic of the latest news for free.
