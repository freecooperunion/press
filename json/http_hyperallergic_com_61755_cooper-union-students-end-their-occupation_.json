Cooper Union has historically been a free school, awarding full scholarships to all of its attendees.</p><p>At the outset, the occupiers issued a set of three demands, which Hyperallergic contributor Janelle Grace <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/61374/students-occupy-historic-cooper-union-clock-tower-to-protest-tuition-charges/\">outlined in a report last week</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#x2026; that the administration &#x201C;stops pursuing new tuition-based educational programs;&#x201D;&#xA0;a greater degree of transparency of the school&#x2019;s finances and the board of trustees&#x2019; actions; and that Dr. Bharucha &#x2013; newly inaugurated last year &#x2014; resigns as president.</p></blockquote><p>None of the demands have been met. Instead, three students <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/61582/student-protests-at-cooper-union-continue-into-fourth-day/\">worked their way into a board of trustees meeting</a> on Wednesday and issued public minutes as well as a recording of the proceedings, while the Cooper Union administration responded to the occupation with a <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/61635/cooper-union-responds-to-occupation-during-supporters-day-of-action/\">press release</a> stating that the board stands fully behind President Jamshed Bharucha.</p><div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Foundation-Building-320.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The occupiers&#x2019; sign at Cooper Union (photo by Janelle Grace)</p></div><p>Given the lack of progress, it&#x2019;s not clear why the occupiers &#x2014; whom Reverend Billy called the &#x201C;Free Tuition 11&#x2033; in at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/27631865\">today&#x2019;s press conference</a> &#x2014; left their post. Perhaps they feel they&#x2019;ve called sufficient attention to the situation, and/or realized that they could be more effective by acting on the ground. In remarks at the press conference, two students emphasized the group&#x2019;s plans to take matters into their own hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Now we feel empowered to meet these demands ourselves,&#x201D; said one speaker. A second called thir actions thus far&#xA0;&#x201D;the beginnings of structural changes that will create open flows of information and truly democratic decision-making at Cooper Union.&#x201D;&#xA0;She went on:</p><blockquote><p>Today we make a promise to the administration, to the Board of Trustees, and to the general public: there will be student and faculty participation at the next board meeting, and the next board meeting, and the next.&#xA0;As we move forward, we will implement a process by which board members may be removed through a vote from the Cooper Union community comprised by students, faculty, alumni, and administrators. And finally, with regard to leadership. Jamshed Bharucha&#x2019;s absence and lack of direct communication over the past week has made it clear that he is a liability to this institution.&#xA0;We can declare without hesitation that Jamshed Barucha is no longer our president.</p></blockquote><p>Seeking more information about how the group plans to implement these plans moving forward, Hyperallergic attempted to reach a number of the occupiers by email and phone. We received no response. But perhaps predictably, the students ended their press conference by painting the occupation as a success: &#x201C;These are not merely antics,&#x201D; said one of the speakers. &#x201C;They are a shift in power. Our only regret is that we didn&#x2019;t lock-in sooner.&#x201D;</p> <p class=\"post_tags\">Tagged as: <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/cooper-union/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">Cooper Union</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/education/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">education</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/protests/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">protests</a></p>  </div></div>",
