The gift is now on hold due to space constraints and will likely force Berlin to set a timetable for constructing an Old Masters museum, which would clear the Gem&#xE4;ldegalerie for 20th-century art. \"If they don&#x2019;t find a space, we will withdraw our offer, but I don&#x2019;t think that will happen,\" said Heiner Pietzsch.
