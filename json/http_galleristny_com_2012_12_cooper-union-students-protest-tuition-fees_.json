Cooper Union <a href=\"http://galleristny.com/2012/04/cooper-union-plans-to-charge-graduate-students-tuition-ending-more-than-a-century-of-free-education/\">announced </a>that it would be charging tuition for the first time in its history last April.&#xA0; At that time, the school said that it would not charge tuition to the undergraduate class starting classes in September 2013, but the fate of future classes remains uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>The students are asking that Cooper Union &#x201C;publicly affirm the college&#x2019;s commitment to free education,&#x201D; according to a statement sent to administrators that was <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/students-seize-cooper-union-room-to-protest-possible-tuition/\">quoted by</a> <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>&#x2018; City Room blog. A banner reading &#x201C;FREE EDUCATION TO ALL&#x201D; has been hung from the school&#x2019;s clock tower at Astor Place.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"reporter-feeds\">Follow Michael H.
