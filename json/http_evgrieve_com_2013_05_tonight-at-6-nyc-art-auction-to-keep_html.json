Bring poetry, chalk, puppets, paints, pencils, easels, songs, tap dance routines. <br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>Statement from Students at Cooper Union:<br>\n<br>\nFor Immediate Release:<br>\n<br>\n50+ students, faculty, and staff are maintaining a &#x2018;sit-in&#x2019; inside Jamshed Bharucha&#x2019;s office on the 7th floor of the Foundation Building of the Cooper Union. As students we have reclaimed the President&#x2019;s office in response to the Administration and the Board of Trustees announcing the implementation of tuition for the incoming class of 2014- desecrating a 154 year old tradition of meritocracy and free education. We stand together with the extended Cooper community in opposition to this decision; we reaffirm all of the previous and future actions of our fellow students and allies.</blockquote><br>\nWEAR red squares <br>\nBRING pots and pans<br>\nLet's make our solidarity seen &amp; heard around the world!</blockquote><br>\n<b>Live updates here:</b><br>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/freecooperunion\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://facebook.com/freecooperunion\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://ustream.tv/channel/free-cooper-union\" target=\"_blank\">Ustream</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://evgrieve.com/2013/05/developing-students-take-presidents.html\">Previously.</a>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",
