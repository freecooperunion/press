All early applicants to Cooper Union&#x2019;s School of Art have been notified that, in fact, the school won&#x2019;t accepting early applicants for the 2013-2014 school year after all. Of course, there&#x2019;s a reason why the school is singling out potential art students: the School of Art is the only Cooper Union department to publicly issue a <a href=\"http://cusos.org/cooper-union-art-faculty-vote-to-reject-tuition/\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> condemning the Board&#x2019;s plan to potentially institute tuition for the first time in the school&#x2019;s history. The school&#x2019;s other two colleges, Engineering and Architecture, have issued no statement on the matter.</p>\n<p>Current students and faculty are none too happy with this news, and today, they&#x2019;re holding a press conference and rally to voice their dismay. Here&#x2019;s how to meet up with the Cooper Union community:</p>\n<p><strong>Deferred Early Decision Applicant Press Conference</strong><br>\nWed.
