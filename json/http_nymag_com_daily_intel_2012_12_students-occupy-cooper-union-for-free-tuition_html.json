The East Village college <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/cooper-union-to-charge-graduate-students.html\">started taking money</a> from graduate students this year, while current undergrads have been guaranteed a free ride through 2017. From there, financial concerns have made the future uncertain in what the occupiers see as a symbolic blow to the institution's founding principles. Their <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/115358350/Communique-Administration\">demands</a> include the abandonment of any \"tuition-based educational programs,\" transparency from the Board of Trustees, and the resignation of president Jamshed Bharucha. In other words, they could be up there for a while.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"parbase section entrytext\">\n\n\n\n    <p>\"We will continue holding this space until our demands are met or we are otherwise removed: we will not negotiate,\" the group <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/students-for-a-free-cooper-union-call-for-press-conference-tuesday-afternoon/\">announced</a> today. \"To this point we have publicly presented our terms and principles and reached out to the broader community and press, but we have yet to be contacted in any capacity by the president. Faced with ideological opposition to the expansionist model, Jamshed Bharucha has withdrawn from public view and shirked his responsibilities overseeing the college.\"</p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"parbase section entrytext\">\n\n\n\n    <p>The administration reportedly had an emergency meeting yesterday at the president's house and told the <a href=\"http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2012/12/03/cooper-union-students-stage-day-of-action-occupation/\">New School <em>Free Press </em></a>they were \"still assessing the situation.\" One attempt by the school to push into the occupation was abandoned after twenty minutes, <a href=\"http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-students-barricade-themselves-at-cooper-union,0,5059488.story\">WPIX reports</a>.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"parbase section entrytext\">\n\n\n\n    <p>The students, meanwhile, have set up camp with laptops and a hammock and were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">tweeting the night away</a>,&#xA0;but they already exposed a weakness: \"We're here.
