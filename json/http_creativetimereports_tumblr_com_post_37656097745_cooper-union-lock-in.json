Literally. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Students Occupying the Peter Cooper Suite at Cooper Union\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu03ecuWm1r75aah.jpg\"></p>\n<p>On Monday, December 3rd, eleven students barricaded themselves in the Peter Cooper Suite on the 8th floor of the Foundation Building, behind the clock tower, in protest. Cooper Union has been tuition-free for 110 years, but financial hardship has prompted the administration to instate tuition fees. The <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/students-for-a-free-cooper-union-lock-in-to-cooper-unions-foundation-building-to-preserve-free-education-2/\">lock-in</a> was in response to what students feel is a&#xA0;lack of transparency and accountability from the administration that threatens the college&#x2019;s long-standing commitment to free education.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Student Protest Sign Featuring a Painting of Peter Cooper the School's Founder\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0cpz9Cr1r75aah.jpg\"></p><p>For the entire week, students on the ground, <a href=\"http://cusos.org/\">online</a>, and locked in the clock tower organized and rallied to support the issue and demand change. Leave it to brilliant art and engineering students to execute creative methods of peaceful protest and solidarity. The <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/projects/teach-4-amerika/\">Bruce High Quality Foundation</a>, made up of Cooper Union alumni, played an instrumental role in demonstrating their support, including delivering pizza up to the 8th floor via <a href=\"http://creativetime.tumblr.com/post/37210912145/whoa-bruce-high-quality-foundation-is-sending\">balloon</a> and hosting a dance party in the rain outside the Foundation Building. A city-wide <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/photos-videos-and-reflections-on-the-free-cooper-union-rally-dec-8th-2012/\">rally</a> was held on Saturday, December 8th, bringing together students from schools across the city and the Cooper community, including alumni who graduated as early as 1946.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Balloons Brought by Bruce High Quality Foundation to Lift Pizza to Locked-In Students\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0e5miCt1r75aah.jpg\"></p>\n<p>At noon today, Monday, December 10th, supporting faculty and the dean of the art school accompanied the eleven students down from the 8th floor after a full week of occupation. The students were each carrying a rose given to them by the dean and were welcomed by a cheering fans and the press. A <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/27631865\">statement</a> was given by the lock-in students explaining that the Cooper Union community has reaffirmed their commitment to the mission statement of the school and they will work together on the ground to achieve the goals they set out.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Students on the Ground After Eight Days Locked In; Casey Gollan Holds a Rose Given in Support by the Dean of the Art School\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0ldbazJ1r75aah.jpg\"></p>\n<p>There was impressive press coverage throughout last week, as well as solidarity displayed online via <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion?fref=ts\">facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">twitter</a>. Livestream video coverage of the Peter Cooper suite documented the occupation and <em><a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/\">Students for a Free Cooper Union</a></em> regularly updated their blog. The lock-in is over, but the fight for a free Cooper Union and against student debt across the country is just beginning.</p>\n<p><em>Text and photos by Creative Time Communications Intern&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/foebster\">Phoebe Pundyk</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Holiday Card Distributed by Students for a Free Cooper Union at Today's Press Conference\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0k6AJDD1r75aah.jpg\"></p>\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        </div>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>",
