The school is one of the last tuition-free colleges in the nation, as well as one of the most selective, but like many institutions, it's been taking big financial blows, with a $16.5 million budget deficit.\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n  <b>Student Protests</b>\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n  Students aren't happy, and many are protesting the decision as part of <span class=\"yshortcuts\" id=\"lw_1368643941321_2\">Free Cooper Union</span>. At least 50 students have now set up camp in school President <span class=\"yshortcuts\" id=\"lw_1368643941321_3\">Jamshed Bharucha</span>'s office. As of 11 a.m. on May 15, the office has been occupied for a week. According to a video and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/334515613491920899/photo/1\">photo</a> posted by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">Free Cooper Union</a> on Twitter, students have painted the lobby outside Bharucha's office black. A followup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/334690737717403648/photo/1\">photo</a> shows the area painted black with \"$750,000\" in white numbers on the wall, which is said to be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://nplusonemag.com/save-cooper-union\">the president's compensation package</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It's not the first time students have taken a stand. In December 2012, amid rumors of the school potentially charging tuition, 11 students <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/cooper-union-students-end-occupation-of-suite-after-a-week/\">barricaded themselves</a> for a week in the school's Foundation Building. Small groups of additional protestors continued to pop up around campus.\n  </p>\n\n<b>Complaints</b>\n\n\n<p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/why-cooper-union-students-are-protesting-2013-5\">Some believe</a> that the school's endowment, left by founder <span class=\"yshortcuts\" id=\"lw_1368643941321_5\">Peter Cooper</span>, has been grossly mismanaged, and it's caused the deficit to grow since the 1970s. There are also some who think that a severe lack of communication between the board and student body has only contributed to the problem. Victoria Sobel, a senior at the art school, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/5/8/video_cooper_union_students_occupy_presidents_office_to_protest_end_to_free_tuition\">stated in an open letter to Bharucha,</a> \"[Bharucha] is no longer welcome in this office space. It is one that's been reclaimed by the students, for the students, for this school. It's not about tuition. It's about repealing tuition. It's about reclaiming administrative spaces and re-examining the roles of administration within a school context.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  In April 2012, the school, which focuses on engineering, art, and architecture, announced that it <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/cooper-union-will-charge-tuition-for-graduate-students.html\">would charge tuition</a> only to its graduate students, but the decision has now been expanded to all students. Starting in 2014, new students will be billed about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/business/how-cooper-unions-endowment-failed-in-its-mission.html?pagewanted=all\">$20,000 per year</a>. Current students won't be affected. A protest is reportedly scheduled for 6 p.m. on May 15 at Cooper Square.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 2012 and 2013, <span class=\"yshortcuts\" id=\"lw_1368643941321_4\">Cooper Union</span> was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cooper.edu/about/news/cooper-union-ranked-1-us-news-best-colleges-2013\">ranked No. 1</a> on the U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Regional Colleges (North) list.\n</p>\n\n</div></div>",
