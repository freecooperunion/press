Schools with massive enough endowments don't really <i>need</i> tuition revenue the way defunded state universities do, and CU has been, until now, a useful if small-scale example of that.

Students aren't meaningfully engaged in the high level decision making or financial management of the institutions they participate in. It's the prerogative and responsibility of the student body to assert their perspective on the institution's direction, administration can propose solutions. </p><p>\nI've participated in bodies responsible for some of the highest level administrative and financial decision making at the institution of my employment. I can say, quite definitively, that students are not engaged at that level. Until they are it's bogus to expect them to not only point out problems but offer clear, definitive solutions. Students just need to put pressure on the bodies/people that do make those decisions, and leverage what ever authority they can towards shaping the outcome.<br><span class=\"smallcopy\">posted by <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/user/114378\" target=\"_self\">Stagger Lee</a> at <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/122632/Great-Wealth-Is-A-Public-Trust#4721156\" target=\"_self\">9:43 AM</a>  on December 7 [<a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/favorited/2/4721156\" title=\"3 users marked this as favorite\">3 favorites</a>] </span></p></div><div class=\"comments\"><em>...but outside of extraordinary circumstances, that doesn't happen at most schools.</em><p>\nI believe Cooper Union mandates a rather high minimum GPA to retain the scholarship and matriculation (I believe you're ejected from the school if you can't maintain it, but I could be wrong.) Last Cooper student I spoke with (this was a while ago) cited as 3.5, and Cooper Union is a <em>gauntlet</em> of a university.
