Historically, attendees have been granted a full scholarship, however, that 110-year tradition could be in jeopardy should the storied institution adopt this new pay model. The <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/students-seize-cooper-union-room-to-protest-possible-tuition/\">reports</a> that the students are holding down the &#x201C;eight eighth-floor room at the top of the Cooper Union Foundation Building&#x201D; which is also referred to as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaysKali/status/275651241617547266/photo/1/large\">the Clocktower</a>, making it by far the coolest place to occupy. A banner calling for &#x201C;Free Education&#x201D; was draped out the window, attempts by maintenance workers to enter have been thwarted, and their @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">FreeCooperUnion</a> Twitter handle has been broadcasting updates. ANIMAL is currently in touch with the resistance and has dispatched a crack editorial team to investigate the matter firsthand.
