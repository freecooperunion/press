The 14 slides of the purported Powerpoint presentation appear to have been scanned from a printed copy; Hyperallergic was told yesterday that this document arrived in an anonymous email, today Free Cooper representatives declined to specify the medium in which the document was received. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If authentic, the presentation could prove problematic for Cooper Union&#x2019;s embattled administration, as it would reveal a remarkably aggressive strategic vision for the school, including a renewed focus on computer science and engineering and &#x201C;phas[ing] out current fine arts program&#x201D; in favor of a Design School. The document also mentions &#x201C;50% tuition&#x201D; as an inevitability two months before the school <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/69520/the-end-of-a-free-cooper-union/\">publicly announced</a> the matter in April. But it&#x2019;s all a little too perfect &#x2014; the presentation&#x2019;s hyperbolic language reads at times like a satirist&#x2019;s parroting of insipid MBA jargon: &#x201C;next level,&#x201D; &#x201C;poised,&#x201D; &#x201C;thought leaders,&#x201D; &#x201C;seize on opportunities afforded by a fast changing world,&#x201D; &#x201C;partner with &#x2026; TED.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>At any rate, we&#x2019;ve reached out to Cooper Union for comment and will update this post as needed. But the kicker for the Free Cooper Union press release announcing this leak may offer a clue: &#x201C;In celebration of open flows of information, on November 24th from 6 to 9pm, students will be performing a second reading of the <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/05/cooper_union_secret_transcript.php\" target=\"_blank\">Board transcript leaked this summer by the <em>Village Voice</em></a> at e-flux, 311 East Broadway, New York.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-93309\" alt=\"design_dream\" src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/design_dream.png\" width=\"640\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&#x201C;The Dream Scenario, Trustee Reinvention Committee, February 12, 2013&#x2033; has been posted in full on the Free Cooper Union <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.551645201582969.1073741862.391957684218389&amp;type=1\">Facebook page</a>.</em></p><p class=\"post_tags\">Tagged as: <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/leaks/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">\"Leaks\"</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/cooper-union/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">Cooper Union</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/free-cooper-union/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">Free Cooper Union</a></p></div></div>",
