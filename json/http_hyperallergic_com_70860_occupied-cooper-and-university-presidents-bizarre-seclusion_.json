Just ask Cooper Union president Jamshed Bharucha, whose imperious refusal to communicate even the most threadbare reaction to his mounting critics has added a new, Spartan character to the meaning of &#x201C;embattled.&#x201D;</p><div id=\"attachment_70895\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-70895\" alt=\"A poster in the Foundation Building lobby on Friday evening of Cooper Union president Jamshed Bharucha with clown accents.\" src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cooper-pres-320.jpg\" width=\"320\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A poster in the Foundation Building lobby on Friday evening of Cooper Union president Jamshed Bharucha with clown accents.</p></div><p>So, when roughly thirty minutes ago the Free Cooper Union Twitter account announced students were marching on Bharucha&#x2019;s residence, even the most iron-hearted counterrevolutionary would have to concede that such action is at this point understandable. Indeed, Free Cooper Union&#x2019;s Twitter feed, which has gained over 1,000 followers in the last 72 hours, has been an object lesson in how to execute public relations: firm, nonthreatening, nonviolent, communicative support for the underlying movement.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"500\"><p>Student: The school of art early admissions were canceled and the faculty were threatened that school would be closed</p><p>&#x2014; Free Cooper Union (@FreeCooperUnion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/332965749062791168\">May 10, 2013</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"500\"><p>Board Sec.

Though there were some concerns on Wednesday, with security services allegedly shoving and lightly injuring some students, the front-door-phalanx guarding the entrance to the Foundation Building has been eagle-eyed. Late last night, I tried to enter the building, but was thwarted and threatened with arrest. Today, a tenured faculty member tried to escort me in, but I was spotted and ejected as I was entering the elevator. The <em>Village Voice</em> had much greater success on this matter yesterday, with a professor smuggling in a journalist&#xA0;<em>and </em>a&#xA0;photographer, their resulting <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/05/muncy_cooper_occupy.php\" target=\"_blank\">report and photo-essay</a> is well-worth a read.</p><p><a href=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-38.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-70889 aligncenter\" alt=\"photo 3\" src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-38.jpg\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>If only such gimlet-eyed assurance shone through in other areas of Bharucha&#x2019;s Cooper regime &#x2014; perhaps he wouldn&#x2019;t then be trapped in a room somewhere, maybe even his residence on Stuyvesant Street, where scores of his opponents are currently amassed, chanting slogans and calling for his career on a stick.</p><div id=\"attachment_70890\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-70890\" alt=\"photo 4\" src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-41.jpg\" width=\"640\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sort-of Blue Brothers, who are responsible for Cooper security.</p></div> <p class=\"post_tags\">Tagged as: <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/free-cooper-union/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">Free Cooper Union</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/jamshed-bharucha/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">Jamshed Bharucha</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/protests/\" rel=\"tag nofollow\">protests</a></p> </div></div>",
