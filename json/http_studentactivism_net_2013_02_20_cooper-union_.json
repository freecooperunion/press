By announcing that the school to which they applied does not intend to honor their commitment to the early admissions process, and that it in fact has no &#x201C;sustainable model&#x201D; for operating in the future, Cooper Union will surely drive many of those applicants &#x2014; the very students who were most committed to enrolling at CU &#x2014; to other colleges.</p>\n<p>As I wrote last fall, <a href=\"http://studentactivism.net/2012/12/12/how-tuition-hurts-colleges/\">Cooper Union&#x2019;s reputation rests more than usually on the quality of its students</a>. To dilute the college&#x2019;s applicant pool as part of an attempt to force recalcitrant faculty to accede to administration policies they abhor is an astoundingly short-sighted and pernicious act.</p>\n<p>It is, as a group of activist students at Cooper Union have said, <a href=\"http://cusos.org/student-rally-and-press-conference-for-deferred-early-decision-applicants/\">a betrayal</a>:</p>\n<p>These applicants have gone above and beyond their due diligence in holding up their end of the application process &#x2026;&#xA0;applicants and their families were told on numerous occasions by administrators, the school&#x2019;s official website, and admissions literature that the incoming class of 2017 would not be affected by the financial struggles plaguing the Cooper Union.</p>\n<p>Cooper Union students, who last semester <a href=\"http://studentactivism.net/2012/12/07/free-cooper-union-occupation-rolls-on/\">occupied a campus building for most of a week</a> in opposition to the tuition plan, <a href=\"http://cusos.org/student-rally-and-press-conference-for-deferred-early-decision-applicants/\">will be holding a rally</a> in support of the deferred students at one o&#x2019;clock this afternoon.</p>\n<p>More to come.</p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-3467503-9146\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Like this:</h3><p class=\"post-likes-widget-placeholder\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></p><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div></div>\t</div>\n\t\t</div>",
