The parcels are located at <a href=\"http://therealdeal.com/blog/2013/03/27/236316/\" target=\"_blank\">51 Astor Place</a> and 22-36 Astor Place, respectively.</p>\n<p>The lot at 22-36 Astor Place was formerly a parking lot that the school leased to Related for a 21-story luxury residential build that opened in 2005.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Cooper Union was exempt from taxes until the 2011 fiscal year. The IBO predicted the tax break could cost the city $2.1 million in tax revenue in this year alone.</p>\n<p>The cost of the 51 Astor place is not yet known, since the property has not opened yet. The school will occupy one floor of Minskoff&#x2019;s 13-story building.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The other universities don&#x2019;t get to do these kinds of commercial deals,&#x201D; Doug Turetsky, IBO chief of staff, told Crain&#x2019;s.</p>\n<p>Cooper Union also owns the land under the Chrysler Building, for which it doesn&#x2019;t pay tax, in order to partly fund its budget. The city will lose $20 million in tax revenue from this deal.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if there is anything the city can do about these deals now that there is no more totally free tuition,&#x201D; Turetsky told Crain&#x2019;s. <a href=\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130605/ECONOMY/130609962\" target=\"_blank\">[Crain's]</a> &#x2013;Zachary Kussin</p>\n<div class=\"post-tags-list\">Tags: <a href=\"http://therealdeal.com/blog/tag/cooper-union/\" title=\"cooper union\">cooper union</a>, <a href=\"http://therealdeal.com/blog/tag/edward-minskoff/\" title=\"Edward Minskoff\">Edward Minskoff</a>, <a href=\"http://therealdeal.com/blog/tag/related-companies/\" title=\"Related Companies\">Related Companies</a></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>",
